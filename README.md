# Quantum-task-4: Soil erosion detection

```diff
- Disclaimer: did not succeed.
```

## Task description
Here is one of the open problems in Quantum. Soil erosion is a really unwanted process that spoils huge areas of fertile land. Your task is to train model for erosion detection.

__What do you have__:
- Sentinel2 tile (T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2);
- Masks with soil erosion for this tile (masks directory);

__What should we get__:

As usual it should be github repository that contains:
-	jupyter notebook with data analysis;
-	script for model training (preferably tf.keras);
-	readme file;
-	requirements.txt file;
-	solution report. This is the most important part. We expect here not only solution description but also your proposals and result of research in different papers about soil erosion detection problem. In other words - what can help us to solve problem in the most effective way.

## File overview
Data analisys is done in _quantum_task4_analysis.ipynb_ notebook and model training in _quantum_task4_training.ipynb_.
Solution report is in _solution_report.docx_.

All the files produced by the notebooks can be found here: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NxKSmxy7l1SgvOVchVp7Ev9d-ojdYXs0/view?usp=sharing)

## Solution
Solution is described in solution_report.docx. To run/interact with the files click corresponding "open in Colab" button at the top of the notebooks.
